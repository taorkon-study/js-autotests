# JS: Autotesting
Here are my self-practice tasks for Hexlet's course **["JS: Autotesting"](https://ru.hexlet.io/courses/js-testing)**. Regardless of it beaing a bunch of small exercises, I still try to maintain a project-like environment incl. *linter*, *Makefile* and *packaje.json* files.


#### Libraries:
* assert (strict)
